										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many taxpayers have received financial help from their employers and well-wishers for meeting their<br />expenses incurred for treatment of COVID-19. In order to ensure that no income tax liability arises on this<br />account, it has been decided to provide income-tax exemption to the amount received by a taxpayer for<br />medical treatment from an employer or from any person for treatment of COVID-19 during FY 2019-20 and<br />subsequent years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, certain taxpayers have lost their life due to COVID-19. Employers and well-wishers of such<br />taxpayers had extended financial assistance to their family members so that they could cope with the<br />difficulties arisen due to the sudden loss of the earning member of their family. In order to provide relief to<br />the family members of such taxpayer, it has been decided to provide income-tax exemption to ex-gratia<br />payment received by family members of a person from the employer of such person or from other person on<br />the death of the person on account of COVID-19 during FY 2019-20 and subsequent years. The exemption<br />shall be allowed without any limit for the amount received from the employer and the exemption shall be<br />limited to Rs. 10 lakh in aggregate for the amount received from any other persons.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Necessary legislative amendments for the above decisions shall be proposed in due course of time.</p>

<p></p>


<p>The Income Tax Department is launching its new e-filing portal www.incometax.gov.in on 7th June 2021. The new e-filing portal is aimed at providing taxpayer convenience and a modern, seamless experience to taxpayers. Some of the highlights of the new portal are detailed hereunder:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>New taxpayer-friendly portal integrated with immediate processing of Income Tax Returns (ITRs) to issue quick refunds to taxpayers;</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>All interactions and uploads or pending actions will be displayed on a single dashboard for follow-up action by the taxpayer;</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Free of cost ITR preparation software available with interactive questions to help taxpayers for ITRs 1, 4 (online and offline) and ITR 2 (offline) to begin with;</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Facility for preparation of ITRs 3, 5, 6, 7 will be made available shortly;</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Taxpayers will be able to proactively update their profile to provide certain details of income including salary, house property, business/profession which will be used in pre-filling their ITR. Detailed enablement of pre-filling with salary income, interest, dividend, and capital gains will be available after TDS and SFT statements are uploaded (due date is June 30th,2021);</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>New call center for taxpayer assistance for prompt response to taxpayer queries. Detailed FAQs, User Manuals, Videos, and Chabot/live agent also provided;</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Functionalities for filing Income Tax Forms, Add tax professionals, Submit responses to Notices in Faceless Scrutiny or Appeals would be available. It is clarified that the new tax payment system will be launched on June 18th, 2021 after the advance tax installment date to avoid any taxpayer inconvenience. The mobile app will also be released subsequent to the initial launch of the portal, to enable taxpayers to get familiar with the various features. Familiarization with the new system may take some time, so, the Department requests the patience of all taxpayers/stakeholders for the initial period after the launch of the new portal and while other functionalities get released since this is a major transition. This is another initiative by CBDT towards providing ease of compliance to its taxpayers and other stakeholders</p><p><a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbookmyconsultants.com%2Fnew-taxpayer-friendly-e-filing-portal-of-the-income-tax-department-to-be-launched-on-7th-june-2021%2F&amp;linkname=New%2C%20Taxpayer-friendly%20e-filing%20Portal%20of%20the%20Income%20Tax%20Department%20To%20Be%20Launched%20on%207th%20June%202021" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbookmyconsultants.com%2Fnew-taxpayer-friendly-e-filing-portal-of-the-income-tax-department-to-be-launched-on-7th-june-2021%2F&amp;linkname=New%2C%20Taxpayer-friendly%20e-filing%20Portal%20of%20the%20Income%20Tax%20Department%20To%20Be%20Launched%20on%207th%20June%202021" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_whatsapp" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbookmyconsultants.com%2Fnew-taxpayer-friendly-e-filing-portal-of-the-income-tax-department-to-be-launched-on-7th-june-2021%2F&amp;linkname=New%2C%20Taxpayer-friendly%20e-filing%20Portal%20of%20the%20Income%20Tax%20Department%20To%20Be%20Launched%20on%207th%20June%202021" title="WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_email" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbookmyconsultants.com%2Fnew-taxpayer-friendly-e-filing-portal-of-the-income-tax-department-to-be-launched-on-7th-june-2021%2F&amp;linkname=New%2C%20Taxpayer-friendly%20e-filing%20Portal%20of%20the%20Income%20Tax%20Department%20To%20Be%20Launched%20on%207th%20June%202021" title="Email" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a></p><p>The post <a href="https://bookmyconsultants.com/new-taxpayer-friendly-e-filing-portal-of-the-income-tax-department-to-be-launched-on-7th-june-2021/">New, Taxpayer-friendly e-filing Portal of the Income Tax Department To Be Launched on 7th June 2021</a> appeared first on <a href="https://bookmyconsultants.com">Book My Consultants</a>.</p>
