<p><strong>Last month to invest and save taxes</strong></p>



<p>The existing financial year 2021-22 is about to end on March 31. This is the last chance to maximise tax benefits under various sections mentioned below the table. Despite being aware of this deadline, most of the investors postpone their income tax planning to the last minute. If you have not planned your tax-saving investments till now, then do it at the earliest and avoid common investment mistakes. To save your tax, do not buy unnecessary life insurance policies and borrow to invest for saving on taxes. Tax planning is a part of financial planning. Align your tax-saver investments with your goals and overall strategy.</p>

<p><strong>KYC Update in your Bank Accounts</strong></p>



<p id="10">Customers are required to complete updating KYC by March 31, 2022. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had extended the deadline for KYC in bank accounts till March 31, 2022, from the previous deadline of December 31, 2021. The deadline has been extended again due to the surge in the Omnicron variant of the coronavirus in the country.</p>



<p id="11">Customers need to visit their bank branch along with a set of self-attested documents, which include proof of identity and proof of address. The RBI has now allowed the use of digital channels for periodic updation of KYC details of customers. This includes video-KYC and submission of electronic documents through digi-locker to the financial institutions for verification purpose</p>



<p><strong>Last Date for Filing Belated Returns</strong><strong> / Revised Return:</strong></p>



<p>The deadline for filing the income tax return (ITR) for the Financial Year (FY) 2020-21 or Assessment Year (AY) 2021-21 ended on December 31, 2021. But you can still file a belated return till March 31, 2022. However, to file a belated return, you may have to pay a penalty and additional interest on taxes. Besides, there are a few limitations of a belated return. Read more to understand.</p>



<p>A belated return is a return which is filed after the stipulated due date mentioned in the income tax rules. A belated income tax return attracts a late filing fee under Section 234F of the Income Tax (I-T) Act of Rs 1,000 in case the Gross Total taxable income during the financial year does not exceed Rs 5 lakh; or Rs 5,000 otherwise.</p>



<p>If you noted any mistake or discrepancy in your filled return now then you have the opportunity to file Revised return up to March 31, 2022.</p>



<p><strong>Advance Tax Installment</strong></p>



<p id="14">The deadline for filing advance tax is approaching. Any person whose estimated tax liability for the year is Rs 10,000 or more is required to pay advance tax. The advance tax has to be paid in four installments in the financial year itself. The last date for paying the fourth installment of advance tax is March 15, 2022.</p>



<p>This applies to all taxpayers, salaried, freelancers, and businesses. However, a resident senior citizen (an individual of age 60 years or above), not having income from business or profession is not liable to pay advance tax. A salaried person, who doesn’t have any income other than salary, needs not to pay advance tax installments, as employers are required to deduct the applicable tax from monthly salary and pay to the department. Failure to pay correct advance tax on time or short payment of tax attracts penal interest.</p>



<p><strong>PAN-Aadhar Linking</strong></p>



<p id="7">The last date to link your Permanent Account Number (<a href="https://www.news18.com/news/business/pan-aadhaar-linking-deadline-extended-if-you-want-tax-benefits-dont-wait-till-last-day-4216193.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PAN</a>) with their Aadhaar card by March 31, 2022. If not done by the given deadline, the PAN card can become invalid and a fee of Rs 1,000 may be required for linking the PAN card with Aadhaar thereafter. If the PAN card is not linked to Aadhaar, an individual will also not be able to invest in mutual funds, stocks or open a bank account among other things as furnishing a PAN card in all those cases is a must.</p>

In order to ensure that no income tax liability arises on this<br />account, it has been decided to provide income-tax exemption to the amount received by a taxpayer for<br />medical treatment from an employer or from any person for treatment of COVID-19 during FY 2019-20 and<br />subsequent years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, certain taxpayers have lost their life due to COVID-19. Employers and well-wishers of such<br />taxpayers had extended financial assistance to their family members so that they could cope with the<br />difficulties arisen due to the sudden loss of the earning member of their family. In order to provide relief to<br />the family members of such taxpayer, it has been decided to provide income-tax exemption to ex-gratia<br />payment received by family members of a person from the employer of such person or from other person on<br />the death of the person on account of COVID-19 during FY 2019-20 and subsequent years. The exemption<br />shall be allowed without any limit for the amount received from the employer and the exemption shall be<br />limited to Rs. 10 lakh in aggregate for the amount received from any other persons.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Necessary legislative amendments for the above decisions shall be proposed in due course of time.</p>

<p>The Income Tax Department is launching its new e-filing portal www.incometax.gov.in on 7th June 2021. The new e-filing portal is aimed at providing taxpayer convenience and a modern, seamless experience to taxpayers. Some of the highlights of the new portal are detailed hereunder:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>New taxpayer-friendly portal integrated with immediate processing of Income Tax Returns (ITRs) to issue quick refunds to taxpayers;</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>All interactions and uploads or pending actions will be displayed on a single dashboard for follow-up action by the taxpayer;</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Free of cost ITR preparation software available with interactive questions to help taxpayers for ITRs 1, 4 (online and offline) and ITR 2 (offline) to begin with;</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Facility for preparation of ITRs 3, 5, 6, 7 will be made available shortly;</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Taxpayers will be able to proactively update their profile to provide certain details of income including salary, house property, business/profession which will be used in pre-filling their ITR. Detailed enablement of pre-filling with salary income, interest, dividend, and capital gains will be available after TDS and SFT statements are uploaded (due date is June 30th,2021);</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Functionalities for filing Income Tax Forms, Add tax professionals, Submit responses to Notices in Faceless Scrutiny or Appeals would be available. It is clarified that the new tax payment system will be launched on June 18th, 2021 after the advance tax installment date to avoid any taxpayer inconvenience. The mobile app will also be released subsequent to the initial launch of the portal, to enable taxpayers to get familiar with the various features. Familiarization with the new system may take some time, so, the Department requests the patience of all taxpayers/stakeholders for the initial period after the launch of the new portal and while other functionalities get released since this is a major transition. This is another initiative by CBDT towards providing ease of compliance to its taxpayers and other stakeholders</p><p><a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbookmyconsultants.com%2Fnew-taxpayer-friendly-e-filing-portal-of-the-income-tax-department-to-be-launched-on-7th-june-2021%2F&amp;linkname=New%2C%20Taxpayer-friendly%20e-filing%20Portal%20of%20the%20Income%20Tax%20Department%20To%20Be%20Launched%20on%207th%20June%202021" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbookmyconsultants.com%2Fnew-taxpayer-friendly-e-filing-portal-of-the-income-tax-department-to-be-launched-on-7th-june-2021%2F&amp;linkname=New%2C%20Taxpayer-friendly%20e-filing%20Portal%20of%20the%20Income%20Tax%20Department%20To%20Be%20Launched%20on%207th%20June%202021" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_whatsapp" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbookmyconsultants.com%2Fnew-taxpayer-friendly-e-filing-portal-of-the-income-tax-department-to-be-launched-on-7th-june-2021%2F&amp;linkname=New%2C%20Taxpayer-friendly%20e-filing%20Portal%20of%20the%20Income%20Tax%20Department%20To%20Be%20Launched%20on%207th%20June%202021" title="WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_email" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbookmyconsultants.com%2Fnew-taxpayer-friendly-e-filing-portal-of-the-income-tax-department-to-be-launched-on-7th-june-2021%2F&amp;linkname=New%2C%20Taxpayer-friendly%20e-filing%20Portal%20of%20the%20Income%20Tax%20Department%20To%20Be%20Launched%20on%207th%20June%202021" title="Email" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a></p><p>The post <a href="https://bookmyconsultants.com/new-taxpayer-friendly-e-filing-portal-of-the-income-tax-department-to-be-launched-on-7th-june-2021/">New, Taxpayer-friendly e-filing Portal of the Income Tax Department To Be Launched on 7th June 2021</a> appeared first on <a href="https://bookmyconsultants.com">Book My Consultants</a>.</p>

<p></p>


<p>An Education loan helps you to finance your studies (abroad or domestic) also helps to save taxes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(i) <strong>Eligible assessee:</strong> Section 80E provides deduction to an individual assessee in respect of any interest on loan paid by him in the previous year out of his income chargeable to tax.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Analysis:</em></strong> <em>Only an individual can claim this deduction. It is not available to HUF or any other kind of taxpayer.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(ii) <strong>Conditions:</strong> The loan must have been taken for the purpose of pursuing his higher education or for the purpose of higher education of his or her relative. The loan must have been taken from any financial institution or approved charitable institution.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Analysis: </em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>The loan should be taken for higher studies, It does not matter whether such loan is taken for higher studies in India or outside India</em></li>
<li><em>Loans taken from friends or relatives don’t qualify for this deduction.</em></li>
<li><em>No limit to the Maximum Amount of Deduction under this section.</em></li>
<li><em>Multiples loans can be availed for his or her relative, interest paid on all the loans will be allowed as a deduction.</em></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>(iii) <strong>Meaning of Relative:</strong> Spouse and children of the individual or the student for whom the individual is the legal guardian.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(iv) <strong>Meaning of &#8220;Higher education&#8221;</strong><strong>:</strong> It means any course of study (including vocational studies) pursued after passing the Senior Secondary Examination or its equivalent from any school, board or university recognized by the Central Government or State Government or local authority or by any other authority authorized by the Central Government or State Government or local authority to do so. Therefore, interest on a loan taken for pursuing any course after Class XII or its equivalent will qualify for deduction under section 80E.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(v) <strong>Period of deduction:</strong> The deduction is allowed in computing the total income in respect of the initial assessment year (i.e. the assessment year relevant to the previous year, in which the assessee starts paying the interest on the loan) and seven assessment years immediately succeeding the initial assessment year or until the interest is paid in full by the assessee, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Analysis: </em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The deduction is allowable for only interest paid as per Bank Certificate, not for the principal amount.</li>
<li>Period of deduction starts from the year of repayment started and continued up to 8 years from the start year or until the interest is fully repaid whichever is earlier. In other words, if the interest amount paid before 8 years period then the deduction will stop in the same year because this deduction is only for interest paid. Vice versa if full interest not paid in 8 years then you cannot claim a deduction for the interest paid beyond 8 years. So it is better to plan your loan tenure accordingly to get the maximum benefit.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(vi)  <strong>Meaning of &#8220;Approved charitable institution&#8221;:</strong> It means an institution established for charitable purposes and approved by the prescribed authority or an institution referred to in section 80G(2)(a).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(vii) <strong>Meaning of &#8220;Financial institution&#8221;: </strong>It means –</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>a banking company to which the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 applies (including a bank or banking institution referred to in section 51 of the Act); or</li>
<li>any other financial institution which the Central Government may, by</li>
</ul>
<p>notification in the Official Gazette, specify in this behalf.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Higher education loan is taken for study in aboard covered under 80 E or not?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes, you can claim deduction under section 80E for aboard also.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Is Section 80E part of Section 80C?</strong></li>

<p>The income tax department will launch a new e-filing portal on June 7, the directorate of income tax systems said in a notice to all field units, adding that services on the portal will not be available from June 1 till June 6.</p>
<p><br /><br />The portal will not be available for taxpayers as well as department officers and therefore officers have been directed not to fix any compliance dates during the six-day period.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>&#8220;In preparation for the transition to the new system, the existing e-filing portal will not be available to both taxpayers as well as department officers for a period of six days from June 1 to June 6,&#8221; the notice said.</p>
<p><br /><br />Officers have also been asked to schedule hearings or compliances after June 10, so as to give taxpayers time to adjust to the new portal. Pre-scheduled hearings will be preponed or postponed to after June 10.</p>
<p><br /><br />&#8220;It is clarified that ITBA and CPC system will continue to function for assessment-related functions. All orders, notices issued during the period will be visible to taxpayers after the new portal goes live on June 7,&#8221; the notice said.</p>
<p><br /><br />While taxpayers use the e-filing portal to file income tax returns and view other details, officers of the tax department including assessing officers, chief income tax officers for appeal, and principal commissioner income tax interact with taxpayers via e-proceedings through the portal.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Officers also use the portal for issuing notices, show cause notices, and getting responses to various e-proceedings. issuing questionnaires, summons, letters, responding to outstanding tax demand, and even communicating final orders in assessment, appeals, exemption, and penalties.<br /><br /></p>
