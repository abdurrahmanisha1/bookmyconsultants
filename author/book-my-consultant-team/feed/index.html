]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) addressed the National Finance Reporting Authority (NFRA) in response to the submission of &#8220;Revision of the Existing    Accounting Standards: Approach Paper (2020) developed by(ICAI) NFRA and the publication of NFRA Consultation Paper on &#8216;Statutory Audit and Auditing Standards for [Micro, Small and Medium] Companies.&#8217;</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>&#8220;We are awestruck and amazed to discover how the Approach Paper on Revision of Existing Accounting Standards is been accepted by NFRA. It should be noted that when preparing the revised ASS in accordance with the Approach Paper the transparent process was adhered to by ICAI throughout the entire process, where drafts of exposure were released, and comments on them were debated at ASB members of ICAI (which was mainly consisted of members of <a href="https://www.taxscan.in/tag/sebi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEBI</a>, MCA, RBI, C&amp;AG, Industry Bodies). The ICAI&#8217;s Council, as well as NACAS meeting, were also held and lengthy discussions were held. The whole process of issuance of Exposure Drafts and analyzing the comment of the stakeholders ASB from ICAI meetings, and finally submitting the revised draft ASS is in line with the requirements of the Regulatory Impact Assessment,&#8221; the ICAI stated.</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>NFRA has, in the past 15 months not discussed the necessity to conduct Regulatory Impact Assessment or with the members of (NFRA) during its meetings and with (ICAI). &#8216;The ICAI has submitted an approach paper in the month of May of 2020&#8217;. A two-hour presentation was also given to the Chairman of NFRA in which inputs were provided by him to present the standards in a manner that was created on the basis of a logic division. In reality, NFRA requested to submit the revised standards in a specified format by way of a letter of March 11, 2021, which was later submitted. NFRA&#8217;s decision to reject the Approach Paper on Revision of Accounting Standards that are in force on account of the fact that it did not conduct Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) in the absence of proper discussions in the Authority meeting isn&#8217;t appropriate.</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>The Executive Body (Executive) of NFRA is not able to make decisions in relation to ASS and SAS so anything that is related to ASS and SAs must be formally discussed in the NFRA Board meeting. Consequently, NFRA&#8217;s decision to reject or return the Approach Paper with no discussion during the Board meeting is not within the scope of its authority. There was an NFRA Board meeting was held just on September 20th, 2021. The issue related to the Approach Paper could have been debated at that time.</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>In the beginning, it is important to recognize this: the Consultation Paper published by NFRA is not within its operational authority. It is not the responsibility to determine the need for an audit of specific classes is required or not. The statement in which it is stated that Statutory Audit has no role to play in the instance of businesses with a Net Worth lower than INR 250 crores does not reflect any investigation.</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>ICAI suggests that NFRA discuss the Revised approach paper and <a href="https://bookmyconsultants.com/the-commissioner-has-ruled-it-is-the-cgst-refund-doesnt-apply-to-the-shifting-of-input-tax-credit-itc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guidelines</a> at the full-time session of members. The Consultation Paper regarding Statutory Auditing as well as Auditing Standards for MSMCS, be immediately withdrawn and discussed during a full Meeting of the members. It is important to note that the method of communication that was chosen to be used by NFRA i.e. communicating via media is not the way to have selected and this issue must be discussed with Board Members during an NFRA Board meeting.</strong></p>

<p>    </p>



<p>The Orissa High Court granted bail to a CA who&#8217;s indicted of using and passing fake (ITC) valued at (Rs.319.64) Crores. The supplicant, Amit Kumar Agarwal is a CA and is contended of exercising and passing fraudulent (ITC) of (Rs./-) that included claim and false ITC on the basis of fake checks by creating and operating (13) fictitious enterprises. It is revealed from the evidence that on the basis of confidential data and investigation conducted by the deputy commissioner of the Sales Tax and Enforcement Unit, Sambalpur, a report was made against the petitioner on the grounds that he had committed a violation of sections 132(1)(b),(c)&amp;(l) and 132(1)(b), (c)&amp; OGST Act.</p>



<p>The petitioner claimed that the act of the authority in question is clearly motivated, and lacks any real basis. In addition, the claim that he sucked off huge amounts of money through the creation and operating of fictitious companies to be totally fraudulent and unfounded. It is also without any basis. Being an accountant who is Chartered and a Chartered Accountant, he is innocent and has not been harassed in a way that is unnecessary. It is claimed that as the Chartered Accountant, he only authorized the companies alleged to be registered by relying on the documents that were provided to him. These documents are documented in the report of investigation that was submitted to Sambalpur&#8217;s CT as well as the <a href="https://bookmyconsultants.com/latest-gst-news-information-rules-changes-effective-from-jan-1-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GST</a> Enforcement Unit, Sambalpur. The petitioner claims that he&#8217;s neither an authorized dealer nor licensed pursuant to the OGST Act as a registered individual, but was only involved in registration of the companies and was not involved in the business carried out by the companies insofar that, as an authorized Chartered Accountant has only rendered professional services in relation to the registration of the firms alleged to be involved.</p>



<p>The State claimed that the petitioner via an accountant who was a <a href="https://www.taxscan.in/tag/chartered-accountant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chartered Accountant</a> was well aware of the formalities, however, he did not obtain adequate authorization from the so-called 13 fake business entities when applying for registration, filing reports, and meeting other legal requirements required in the OGST Act which clearly proved his involvement in the formation and operation of these fake companies and that such a deliberate and deliberate move was purely to defraud the State, and thus, he&#8217;s individually and jointly accountable for the crime under Section 132(1)(b),(c)&amp;(l) of the OGST Act which is punishable under Section 132(1)(i) of the Act. In support of this contention, the learned counsel for the opposing party State used the evidence each one at a time while responding to the petitioner&#8217;s arguments and also referenced the numerous rulings by the Supreme Court and other High Courts and the orders that rejected the bail plea, focusing the seriousness of economic violations that make up an entire class of their own.</p>



<p>The one judge of Justice R.K. Pattanaik ruled that the petitioner has been ordered to be released under bail after providing a bail bond of Rs.50,00,000 and two sureties that are solvent and in similar amounts at the discretion of the judge below who is seized of the matter. The bail bond must be accompanied by conditions, like, he must not incite, threaten, or intimidate any of the witnesses who are in custody; and shall not use any method to influence or pressure towards witnesses of the prosecution to be scrutinized during the trial, and, consequently, not alter the evidence collected or in any way is not allowed to engage or participate in any similar activities or conducts; surrenders the passport of his, should there is any, in front of the court and will not be able to leave the court&#8217;s jurisdiction without prior approval of the court.</p>

<p></p>



<p>This article covers Important GST Changes that will take effect on January 1, 2022, and how they would affect E-Commerce Platforms like Zomato, Swiggy, and others. Self-assessment tax recovery without the possibility of a difference between GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B, ITCs are available if a supplier files a GSTR-1. (GSTR-1) is being blocked because (GSTR 3B) was not filed. Aadhaar card authentication is required for GSTR revocation and refund applications. Amendments to Sections 129 and 130 of the <a href="https://taxguru.in/goods-and-service-tax/president-assents-central-goods-services-tax-act-2017.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CGST Act, 2017</a>, provide the GSTR Commissioner the right to attach any property, including bank accounts, on a temporary basis. Payment of amount equivalent to 25% of the penalty for filing an appeal against a section 129(3) ruling as a condition of filing an appeal Changes in the GST rate on footwear from 5% to 12%, as well as the GST rate on Works Contract Services for Government Authority Contracts.<br>&amp; Government Entity, as well as GST on services supplied by Associations to its members, starting July 1, 2017.<br></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">GST changes have an impact on e-commerce operators such as Zomato, Swiggy, Ola, Uber, and others.</h2>



<p>The Goods and Services Tax Council voted on September 17 to make e-commerce operators responsible to pay tax on services offered through them, such as passenger transportation by any form of a motor vehicle and restaurant services provided. According to a statement released by the Finance Ministry following the GST Council meeting, this will take effect on January 1, 2022.<br>As you may be aware, the government has issued Directive<a href="https://taxguru.in/goods-and-service-tax/notification-no-17-2021-central-tax-rate-dated-18-11-2021.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> NN. 17/2021- Central Tax (Rate) on November 18, 2021</a>, requiring E-commerce platforms (&#8220;ECO&#8221;) such as Zomato and Swiggy to pay tax on restaurant services beginning January 1, 2022.

<p class="has-text-align-center has-vivid-red-color has-text-color"><strong>The last date of filing ITR is 31st December 2021*</strong></p>



<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>What is ITR?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:18px">The procedure through which a taxpayer must submit a report of his total income received during the fiscal year is known as ITR filing. Individuals can file their tax returns online using the Income Tax Department&#8217;s official portal. It was reported in seven distinct ways: ITR 1, ITR 2, ITR 3, ITR 4, ITR 5, ITR 6, and ITR 7.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>Why should you file ITR?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">In India, it is obligatory to file income tax returns if you meet any of the following criteria:</p>



<ul class="has-black-color has-text-color"><li>Individuals who fall inside the <a href="https://www.bankbazaar.com/tax/income-tax-slabs.html">tax brackets</a>.</li><li>If it is a company or firm, regardless of whether it makes a profit or a loss in a fiscal year.</li><li>If a tax refund is due, it must be claimed.</li><li>If a loss under one of the revenue categories must be carried forward.</li><li>If you are a resident of India, you have an asset or a financial interest in any company that is based outside of India.</li><li>One is a signing authority in a foreign account if they are a resident of India.</li><li>If you receive income from a trust that was established for charities, political parties, research associations, news agencies, educational or medical institutions, trade unions, not-for-profit universities or educational institutions, hospitals, infrastructure debt funds, any authority, body, or trust.</li><li>In the case of a loan or visa application.</li><li>It is taxable in India if an NRI derives any or all of his/her income from sources in India, and income tax returns must be filed accordingly.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>What if you miss the last date to file an ITR?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">Individuals who miss the impending ITR filing deadline can still file by the deadline, which is March 31, 2022. Because the due date was extended this year, the deadline was likewise extended to March 31, 2021.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">However, there is a catch for individuals who file their ITR beyond the due date. They will not be able to carry over any losses for the current year, and they will not be able to offset any revenue for the current year.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>What happens if you fail to file ITR by the last date?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">The income tax department may impose a minimum penalty equivalent to 50% of the tax saved by not filing ITR if a person fails to file by the extended due date (March 31, 2022).</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">It should be mentioned that current income tax regulations provide for a minimum penalty of three years and a maximum term of seven years if the amount of tax attempted to be evaded exceeds Rs 10,000.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
