<p><strong>KYC Update in your Bank Accounts</strong></p>



<p id="10">Customers are required to complete updating KYC by March 31, 2022. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had extended the deadline for KYC in bank accounts till March 31, 2022, from the previous deadline of December 31, 2021. The deadline has been extended again due to the surge in the Omnicron variant of the coronavirus in the country.</p>



<p id="11">Customers need to visit their bank branch along with a set of self-attested documents, which include proof of identity and proof of address. The RBI has now allowed the use of digital channels for periodic updation of KYC details of customers. This includes video-KYC and submission of electronic documents through digi-locker to the financial institutions for verification purpose</p>



<p><strong>Last Date for Filing Belated Returns</strong><strong> / Revised Return:</strong></p>



<p>The deadline for filing the income tax return (ITR) for the Financial Year (FY) 2020-21 or Assessment Year (AY) 2021-21 ended on December 31, 2021. But you can still file a belated return till March 31, 2022. However, to file a belated return, you may have to pay a penalty and additional interest on taxes. Besides, there are a few limitations of a belated return. Read more to understand.</p>



<p>A belated return is a return which is filed after the stipulated due date mentioned in the income tax rules. A belated income tax return attracts a late filing fee under Section 234F of the Income Tax (I-T) Act of Rs 1,000 in case the Gross Total taxable income during the financial year does not exceed Rs 5 lakh; or Rs 5,000 otherwise.</p>



<p>If you noted any mistake or discrepancy in your filled return now then you have the opportunity to file Revised return up to March 31, 2022.</p>



<p><strong>Advance Tax Installment</strong></p>



<p id="14">The deadline for filing advance tax is approaching. Any person whose estimated tax liability for the year is Rs 10,000 or more is required to pay advance tax. The advance tax has to be paid in four installments in the financial year itself. The last date for paying the fourth installment of advance tax is March 15, 2022.</p>



<p>This applies to all taxpayers, salaried, freelancers, and businesses. However, a resident senior citizen (an individual of age 60 years or above), not having income from business or profession is not liable to pay advance tax. A salaried person, who doesn’t have any income other than salary, needs not to pay advance tax installments, as employers are required to deduct the applicable tax from monthly salary and pay to the department. Failure to pay correct advance tax on time or short payment of tax attracts penal interest.</p>



<p><strong>PAN-Aadhar Linking</strong></p>



<p id="7">The last date to link your Permanent Account Number (<a href="https://www.news18.com/news/business/pan-aadhaar-linking-deadline-extended-if-you-want-tax-benefits-dont-wait-till-last-day-4216193.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PAN</a>) with their Aadhaar card by March 31, 2022. If not done by the given deadline, the PAN card can become invalid and a fee of Rs 1,000 may be required for linking the PAN card with Aadhaar thereafter. If the PAN card is not linked to Aadhaar, an individual will also not be able to invest in mutual funds, stocks or open a bank account among other things as furnishing a PAN card in all those cases is a must.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) addressed the National Finance Reporting Authority (NFRA) in response to the submission of &#8220;Revision of the Existing    Accounting Standards: Approach Paper (2020) developed by(ICAI) NFRA and the publication of NFRA Consultation Paper on &#8216;Statutory Audit and Auditing Standards for [Micro, Small and Medium] Companies.&#8217;</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>&#8220;We are awestruck and amazed to discover how the Approach Paper on Revision of Existing Accounting Standards is been accepted by NFRA. It should be noted that when preparing the revised ASS in accordance with the Approach Paper the transparent process was adhered to by ICAI throughout the entire process, where drafts of exposure were released, and comments on them were debated at ASB members of ICAI (which was mainly consisted of members of <a href="https://www.taxscan.in/tag/sebi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEBI</a>, MCA, RBI, C&amp;AG, Industry Bodies). The ICAI&#8217;s Council, as well as NACAS meeting, were also held and lengthy discussions were held. The whole process of issuance of Exposure Drafts and analyzing the comment of the stakeholders ASB from ICAI meetings, and finally submitting the revised draft ASS is in line with the requirements of the Regulatory Impact Assessment,&#8221; the ICAI stated.</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>NFRA has, in the past 15 months not discussed the necessity to conduct Regulatory Impact Assessment or with the members of (NFRA) during its meetings and with (ICAI). &#8216;The ICAI has submitted an approach paper in the month of May of 2020&#8217;. A two-hour presentation was also given to the Chairman of NFRA in which inputs were provided by him to present the standards in a manner that was created on the basis of a logic division. In reality, NFRA requested to submit the revised standards in a specified format by way of a letter of March 11, 2021, which was later submitted. NFRA&#8217;s decision to reject the Approach Paper on Revision of Accounting Standards that are in force on account of the fact that it did not conduct Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) in the absence of proper discussions in the Authority meeting isn&#8217;t appropriate.</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>The Executive Body (Executive) of NFRA is not able to make decisions in relation to ASS and SAS so anything that is related to ASS and SAs must be formally discussed in the NFRA Board meeting. Consequently, NFRA&#8217;s decision to reject or return the Approach Paper with no discussion during the Board meeting is not within the scope of its authority. There was an NFRA Board meeting was held just on September 20th, 2021. The issue related to the Approach Paper could have been debated at that time.</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>In the beginning, it is important to recognize this: the Consultation Paper published by NFRA is not within its operational authority. It is not the responsibility to determine the need for an audit of specific classes is required or not. The statement in which it is stated that Statutory Audit has no role to play in the instance of businesses with a Net Worth lower than INR 250 crores does not reflect any investigation.</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>ICAI suggests that NFRA discuss the Revised approach paper and <a href="https://bookmyconsultants.com/the-commissioner-has-ruled-it-is-the-cgst-refund-doesnt-apply-to-the-shifting-of-input-tax-credit-itc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guidelines</a> at the full-time session of members. The Consultation Paper regarding Statutory Auditing as well as Auditing Standards for MSMCS, be immediately withdrawn and discussed during a full Meeting of the members. It is important to note that the method of communication that was chosen to be used by NFRA i.e. communicating via media is not the way to have selected and this issue must be discussed with Board Members during an NFRA Board meeting.</strong></p>

<p>    </p>



<p>The Orissa High Court granted bail to a CA who&#8217;s indicted of using and passing fake (ITC) valued at (Rs.319.64) Crores. The supplicant, Amit Kumar Agarwal is a CA and is contended of exercising and passing fraudulent (ITC) of (Rs./-) that included claim and false ITC on the basis of fake checks by creating and operating (13) fictitious enterprises. It is revealed from the evidence that on the basis of confidential data and investigation conducted by the deputy commissioner of the Sales Tax and Enforcement Unit, Sambalpur, a report was made against the petitioner on the grounds that he had committed a violation of sections 132(1)(b),(c)&amp;(l) and 132(1)(b), (c)&amp; OGST Act.</p>



<p>The petitioner claimed that the act of the authority in question is clearly motivated, and lacks any real basis. In addition, the claim that he sucked off huge amounts of money through the creation and operating of fictitious companies to be totally fraudulent and unfounded. It is also without any basis. Being an accountant who is Chartered and a Chartered Accountant, he is innocent and has not been harassed in a way that is unnecessary. It is claimed that as the Chartered Accountant, he only authorized the companies alleged to be registered by relying on the documents that were provided to him. These documents are documented in the report of investigation that was submitted to Sambalpur&#8217;s CT as well as the <a href="https://bookmyconsultants.com/latest-gst-news-information-rules-changes-effective-from-jan-1-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GST</a> Enforcement Unit, Sambalpur. The petitioner claims that he&#8217;s neither an authorized dealer nor licensed pursuant to the OGST Act as a registered individual, but was only involved in registration of the companies and was not involved in the business carried out by the companies insofar that, as an authorized Chartered Accountant has only rendered professional services in relation to the registration of the firms alleged to be involved.</p>



<p>The State claimed that the petitioner via an accountant who was a <a href="https://www.taxscan.in/tag/chartered-accountant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chartered Accountant</a> was well aware of the formalities, however, he did not obtain adequate authorization from the so-called 13 fake business entities when applying for registration, filing reports, and meeting other legal requirements required in the OGST Act which clearly proved his involvement in the formation and operation of these fake companies and that such a deliberate and deliberate move was purely to defraud the State, and thus, he&#8217;s individually and jointly accountable for the crime under Section 132(1)(b),(c)&amp;(l) of the OGST Act which is punishable under Section 132(1)(i) of the Act. In support of this contention, the learned counsel for the opposing party State used the evidence each one at a time while responding to the petitioner&#8217;s arguments and also referenced the numerous rulings by the Supreme Court and other High Courts and the orders that rejected the bail plea, focusing the seriousness of economic violations that make up an entire class of their own.</p>



<p>The one judge of Justice R.K.

<p class="has-text-align-center has-vivid-red-color has-text-color"><strong>The last date of filing ITR is 31st December 2021*</strong></p>



<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>What is ITR?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color" style="font-size:18px">The procedure through which a taxpayer must submit a report of his total income received during the fiscal year is known as ITR filing. Individuals can file their tax returns online using the Income Tax Department&#8217;s official portal. It was reported in seven distinct ways: ITR 1, ITR 2, ITR 3, ITR 4, ITR 5, ITR 6, and ITR 7.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>Why should you file ITR?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">In India, it is obligatory to file income tax returns if you meet any of the following criteria:</p>



<ul class="has-black-color has-text-color"><li>Individuals who fall inside the <a href="https://www.bankbazaar.com/tax/income-tax-slabs.html">tax brackets</a>.</li><li>If it is a company or firm, regardless of whether it makes a profit or a loss in a fiscal year.</li><li>If a tax refund is due, it must be claimed.</li><li>If a loss under one of the revenue categories must be carried forward.</li><li>If you are a resident of India, you have an asset or a financial interest in any company that is based outside of India.</li><li>One is a signing authority in a foreign account if they are a resident of India.</li><li>If you receive income from a trust that was established for charities, political parties, research associations, news agencies, educational or medical institutions, trade unions, not-for-profit universities or educational institutions, hospitals, infrastructure debt funds, any authority, body, or trust.</li><li>In the case of a loan or visa application.</li><li>It is taxable in India if an NRI derives any or all of his/her income from sources in India, and income tax returns must be filed accordingly.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>What if you miss the last date to file an ITR?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">Individuals who miss the impending ITR filing deadline can still file by the deadline, which is March 31, 2022. Because the due date was extended this year, the deadline was likewise extended to March 31, 2021.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">However, there is a catch for individuals who file their ITR beyond the due date. They will not be able to carry over any losses for the current year, and they will not be able to offset any revenue for the current year.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>What happens if you fail to file ITR by the last date?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">The income tax department may impose a minimum penalty equivalent to 50% of the tax saved by not filing ITR if a person fails to file by the extended due date (March 31, 2022).</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">It should be mentioned that current income tax regulations provide for a minimum penalty of three years and a maximum term of seven years if the amount of tax attempted to be evaded exceeds Rs 10,000.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many taxpayers have received financial help from their employers and well-wishers for meeting their<br />expenses incurred for treatment of COVID-19. In order to ensure that no income tax liability arises on this<br />account, it has been decided to provide income-tax exemption to the amount received by a taxpayer for<br />medical treatment from an employer or from any person for treatment of COVID-19 during FY 2019-20 and<br />subsequent years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, certain taxpayers have lost their life due to COVID-19. Employers and well-wishers of such<br />taxpayers had extended financial assistance to their family members so that they could cope with the<br />difficulties arisen due to the sudden loss of the earning member of their family. In order to provide relief to<br />the family members of such taxpayer, it has been decided to provide income-tax exemption to ex-gratia<br />payment received by family members of a person from the employer of such person or from other person on<br />the death of the person on account of COVID-19 during FY 2019-20 and subsequent years. The exemption<br />shall be allowed without any limit for the amount received from the employer and the exemption shall be<br />limited to Rs. 10 lakh in aggregate for the amount received from any other persons.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Necessary legislative amendments for the above decisions shall be proposed in due course of time.</p>

<p></p>


<p>The Income Tax Department is launching its new e-filing portal www.incometax.gov.in on 7th June 2021. The new e-filing portal is aimed at providing taxpayer convenience and a modern, seamless experience to taxpayers. Some of the highlights of the new portal are detailed hereunder:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>New taxpayer-friendly portal integrated with immediate processing of Income Tax Returns (ITRs) to issue quick refunds to taxpayers;</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>All interactions and uploads or pending actions will be displayed on a single dashboard for follow-up action by the taxpayer;</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Free of cost ITR preparation software available with interactive questions to help taxpayers for ITRs 1, 4 (online and offline) and ITR 2 (offline) to begin with;</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Facility for preparation of ITRs 3, 5, 6, 7 will be made available shortly;</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Taxpayers will be able to proactively update their profile to provide certain details of income including salary, house property, business/profession which will be used in pre-filling their ITR. Detailed enablement of pre-filling with salary income, interest, dividend, and capital gains will be available after TDS and SFT statements are uploaded (due date is June 30th,2021);</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>New call center for taxpayer assistance for prompt response to taxpayer queries. Detailed FAQs, User Manuals, Videos, and Chabot/live agent also provided;</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Functionalities for filing Income Tax Forms, Add tax professionals, Submit responses to Notices in Faceless Scrutiny or Appeals would be available. It is clarified that the new tax payment system will be launched on June 18th, 2021 after the advance tax installment date to avoid any taxpayer inconvenience. The mobile app will also be released subsequent to the initial launch of the portal, to enable taxpayers to get familiar with the various features. Familiarization with the new system may take some time, so, the Department requests the patience of all taxpayers/stakeholders for the initial period after the launch of the new portal and while other functionalities get released since this is a major transition. This is another initiative by CBDT towards providing ease of compliance to its taxpayers and other stakeholders</p><p><a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbookmyconsultants.com%2Fnew-taxpayer-friendly-e-filing-portal-of-the-income-tax-department-to-be-launched-on-7th-june-2021%2F&amp;linkname=New%2C%20Taxpayer-friendly%20e-filing%20Portal%20of%20the%20Income%20Tax%20Department%20To%20Be%20Launched%20on%207th%20June%202021" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbookmyconsultants.com%2Fnew-taxpayer-friendly-e-filing-portal-of-the-income-tax-department-to-be-launched-on-7th-june-2021%2F&amp;linkname=New%2C%20Taxpayer-friendly%20e-filing%20Portal%20of%20the%20Income%20Tax%20Department%20To%20Be%20Launched%20on%207th%20June%202021" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_whatsapp" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbookmyconsultants.com%2Fnew-taxpayer-friendly-e-filing-portal-of-the-income-tax-department-to-be-launched-on-7th-june-2021%2F&amp;linkname=New%2C%20Taxpayer-friendly%20e-filing%20Portal%20of%20the%20Income%20Tax%20Department%20To%20Be%20Launched%20on%207th%20June%202021" title="WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_email" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbookmyconsultants.com%2Fnew-taxpayer-friendly-e-filing-portal-of-the-income-tax-department-to-be-launched-on-7th-june-2021%2F&amp;linkname=New%2C%20Taxpayer-friendly%20e-filing%20Portal%20of%20the%20Income%20Tax%20Department%20To%20Be%20Launched%20on%207th%20June%202021" title="Email" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a></p><p>The post <a href="https://bookmyconsultants.com/new-taxpayer-friendly-e-filing-portal-of-the-income-tax-department-to-be-launched-on-7th-june-2021/">New, Taxpayer-friendly e-filing Portal of the Income Tax Department To Be Launched on 7th June 2021</a> appeared first on <a href="https://bookmyconsultants.com">Book My Consultants</a>.</p>

<p></p>


<p>An Education loan helps you to finance your studies (abroad or domestic) also helps to save taxes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(i) <strong>Eligible assessee:</strong> Section 80E provides deduction to an individual assessee in respect of any interest on loan paid by him in the previous year out of his income chargeable to tax.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Analysis:</em></strong> <em>Only an individual can claim this deduction. It is not available to HUF or any other kind of taxpayer.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>(ii) <strong>Conditions:</strong> The loan must have been taken for the purpose of pursuing his higher education or for the purpose of higher education of his or her relative. The loan must have been taken from any financial institution or approved charitable institution.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Analysis: </em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>The loan should be taken for higher studies, It does not matter whether such loan is taken for higher studies in India or outside India</em></li>
<li><em>Loans taken from friends or relatives don’t qualify for this deduction.</em></li>
<li><em>No limit to the Maximum Amount of Deduction under this section.</em></li>
<li><em>Multiples loans can be availed for his or her relative, interest paid on all the loans will be allowed as a deduction.</em></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>(iii) <strong>Meaning of Relative:</strong> Spouse and children of the individual or the student for whom the individual is the legal guardian.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(iv) <strong>Meaning of &#8220;Higher education&#8221;</strong><strong>:</strong> It means any course of study (including vocational studies) pursued after passing the Senior Secondary Examination or its equivalent from any school, board or university recognized by the Central Government or State Government or local authority or by any other authority authorized by the Central Government or State Government or local authority to do so. Therefore, interest on a loan taken for pursuing any course after Class XII or its equivalent will qualify for deduction under section 80E.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(v) <strong>Period of deduction:</strong> The deduction is allowed in computing the total income in respect of the initial assessment year (i.e. the assessment year relevant to the previous year, in which the assessee starts paying the interest on the loan) and seven assessment years immediately succeeding the initial assessment year or until the interest is paid in full by the assessee, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Analysis: </em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The deduction is allowable for only interest paid as per Bank Certificate, not for the principal amount.</li>
<li>Period of deduction starts from the year of repayment started and continued up to 8 years from the start year or until the interest is fully repaid whichever is earlier. In other words, if the interest amount paid before 8 years period then the deduction will stop in the same year because this deduction is only for interest paid. Vice versa if full interest not paid in 8 years then you cannot claim a deduction for the interest paid beyond 8 years. So it is better to plan your loan tenure accordingly to get the maximum benefit.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(vi)  <strong>Meaning of &#8220;Approved charitable institution&#8221;:</strong> It means an institution established for charitable purposes and approved by the prescribed authority or an institution referred to in section 80G(2)(a).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(vii) <strong>Meaning of &#8220;Financial institution&#8221;: </strong>It means –</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>a banking company to which the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 applies (including a bank or banking institution referred to in section 51 of the Act); or</li>
<li>any other financial institution which the Central Government may, by</li>
</ul>
<p>notification in the Official Gazette, specify in this behalf.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Higher education loan is taken for study in aboard covered under 80 E or not?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes, you can claim deduction under section 80E for aboard also.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Is Section 80E part of Section 80C?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>No, both are separately allowed. Section 80C of the Income Tax Act provides deduction in respect of the tuition fees paid for the education. However, section 80E of the Income Tax Act provides deduction in respect of interest paid on educational loans taken for higher education.</p><p><a class="a2a_button_facebook" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbookmyconsultants.com%2Fdeduction-in-respect-of-interest-on-loan-taken-for-higher-education-section-80-e%2F&amp;linkname=Deduction%20in%20respect%20of%20interest%20on%20loan%20taken%20for%20higher%20Education%20Section%2080%20E" title="Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_twitter" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbookmyconsultants.com%2Fdeduction-in-respect-of-interest-on-loan-taken-for-higher-education-section-80-e%2F&amp;linkname=Deduction%20in%20respect%20of%20interest%20on%20loan%20taken%20for%20higher%20Education%20Section%2080%20E" title="Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_whatsapp" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbookmyconsultants.com%2Fdeduction-in-respect-of-interest-on-loan-taken-for-higher-education-section-80-e%2F&amp;linkname=Deduction%20in%20respect%20of%20interest%20on%20loan%20taken%20for%20higher%20Education%20Section%2080%20E" title="WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a><a class="a2a_button_email" href="https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbookmyconsultants.com%2Fdeduction-in-respect-of-interest-on-loan-taken-for-higher-education-section-80-e%2F&amp;linkname=Deduction%20in%20respect%20of%20interest%20on%20loan%20taken%20for%20higher%20Education%20Section%2080%20E" title="Email" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"></a></p><p>The post <a href="https://bookmyconsultants.com/deduction-in-respect-of-interest-on-loan-taken-for-higher-education-section-80-e/">Deduction in respect of interest on loan taken for higher Education Section 80 E</a> appeared first on <a href="https://bookmyconsultants.com">Book My Consultants</a>.</p>
