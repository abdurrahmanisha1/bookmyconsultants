The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had extended the deadline for KYC in bank accounts till March 31, 2022, from the previous deadline of December 31, 2021. The deadline has been extended again due to the surge in the Omnicron variant of the coronavirus in the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"11\">Customers need to visit their bank branch along with a set of self-attested documents, which include proof of identity and proof of address. The RBI has now allowed the use of digital channels for periodic updation of KYC details of customers. This includes video-KYC and submission of electronic documents through digi-locker to the financial institutions for verification purpose<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Last Date for Filing Belated Returns<\/strong><strong> \/ Revised Return:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deadline for filing the income tax return (ITR) for the Financial Year (FY) 2020-21 or Assessment Year (AY) 2021-21 ended on December 31, 2021. But you can still file a belated return till March 31, 2022. However, to file a belated return, you may have to pay a penalty and additional interest on taxes. Besides, there are a few limitations of a belated return. Read more to understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A belated return is a return which is filed after the stipulated due date mentioned in the income tax rules. A belated income tax return attracts a late filing fee under Section 234F of the Income Tax (I-T) Act of Rs 1,000 in case the Gross Total taxable income during the financial year does not exceed Rs 5 lakh; or Rs 5,000 otherwise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you noted any mistake or discrepancy in your filled return now then you have the opportunity to file Revised return up to March 31, 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advance Tax Installment<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"14\">The deadline for filing advance tax is approaching. Any person whose estimated tax liability for the year is Rs 10,000 or more is required to pay advance tax. The advance tax has to be paid in four installments in the financial year itself. The last date for paying the fourth installment of advance tax is March 15, 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This applies to all taxpayers, salaried, freelancers, and businesses. However, a resident senior citizen (an individual of age 60 years or above), not having income from business or profession is not liable to pay advance tax. A salaried person, who doesn\u2019t have any income other than salary, needs not to pay advance tax installments, as employers are required to deduct the applicable tax from monthly salary and pay to the department. Failure to pay correct advance tax on time or short payment of tax attracts penal interest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PAN-Aadhar Linking<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"7\">The last date to link your Permanent Account Number (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.news18.com\/news\/business\/pan-aadhaar-linking-deadline-extended-if-you-want-tax-benefits-dont-wait-till-last-day-4216193.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PAN<\/a>) with their Aadhaar card by March 31, 2022. If not done by the given deadline, the PAN card can become invalid and a fee of Rs 1,000 may be required for linking the PAN card with Aadhaar thereafter. If the PAN card is not linked to Aadhaar, an individual will also not be able to invest in mutual funds, stocks or open a bank account among other things as furnishing a PAN card in all those cases is a must.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tax Planning for FY 2021-22<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":9135,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_active":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_note":"","_monsterinsights_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[114],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Income Tax Planning &amp;
