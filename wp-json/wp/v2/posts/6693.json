After following the above \u2018e-invoicing\u2019 process, the invoice copy containing inter alia, the IRN (with QR Code) issued by the notified supplier to the buyer is commonly referred to as\u00a0\u2018e-invoice\u2019 in GST.\u00a0<\/p><p>Please note that \u2018e-invoice\u2019 in \u2018e-invoicing\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean a generation of invoices by a Government portal.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>2.\u00a0<strong>Difference between the present system and\u00a0\u2018e-invoicing\u2019\u00a0<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Ans:\u00a0<\/strong>There is no much difference indeed.
